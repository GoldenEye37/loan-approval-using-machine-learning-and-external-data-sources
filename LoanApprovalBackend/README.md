## Loan Approval Backend API

This is the backend API for the Loan Approval project. It is built using Django and Django REST Framework.
The project uses machine learning to predict whether a loan application should be approved or denied based on the applicant's information.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LoanApprovalBackend.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd LoanApprovalBackend
    ```

3. Set up a virtual environment:
    ```
    python -m venv env
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
    On Windows, run:
    ```
    env\Scripts\activate
    ```
    On Unix or MacOS, run:
    ```
    source env/bin/activate
    ```

5. Install the required dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

6. Set up your environment variables in a `.env` file. Refer to the `.env.example` file in the repository for the variables you need to set.

7. Apply the migrations:
    ```
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

8. Run the server:
    ```
